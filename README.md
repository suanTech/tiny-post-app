##  🌪️ Troubleshooting

###  Error: Invalid src prop error when loading image from google account

**Error Message**

```
Error: Invalid src prop (https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZC07km7Uhz-TB_g0zKePq2GhmlUtt2HcOIRFNXBQ=s96-c) 
on `next/image`, hostname "lh3.googleusercontent.com" is not configured under images in your `next.config.js`
```

**Problem**

(According to Next.js docs,) One of your pages that leverages the next/image component, passed a src value that uses a hostname in the URL that isn't defined in the images.remotePatterns in next.config.js.

**Solution**
Update next.config.js file(add image domains to be directed)
```js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  images: {
    domains: ["lh3.googleusercontent.com"]
  },
}
```
###  Error: React Query type error

**Error Message**

```jsx
Type error: Type 'string | string[] | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'.
```

**Problem**

The web address protocols allows assigning of multiple query names with the same name. These then get passed as a string[] instead of a single string.
E.g, ?value=one&value=two. Therefore it should be up to the app to decide which value to accept if it's only going to make use of one string.

**Solution**
Type narrowing using Array.isArray checking
```ts
const postId = Array.isArray(req.query.details) ? req.query.details[0] : req.query.details
      const data = await prisma.post.findUnique({
        where: {
          id: postId
        },
```

## 🔜 Future Challenge
- [ ] Testing app 
- [ ] Add other authO options for sign in
